# HeliumBoot/EFI
HeliumBoot/EFI is a simple UEFI bootloader, intended for research on how bootloaders work.

## Features
HeliumBoot/EFI has these features that distinguish it from other simple bootloaders:
 * Portability - it runs on x86_64 and aarch64 targets, powered by GNU-EFI.
 * Command support - A built-in command parser, but powerful, simple, and easy to implement new commands.
 * Unix SVR4 VTOC support
 * File system support: S5, UFS, BFS
